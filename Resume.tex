\begin{cvsection}{Relevant Work History}	
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Civil Engineer}{WHPacific}{2012 - 2014}
		\compDesc{Regional engineering firm focused on enhancing client satisfaction through creative, exceptional service.}
		\tools{AutoCAD CIVIL 3D 2009-2014, ArcGIS, Bentley StormCAD, USACE HEC-RAS, EPA LT1ESWTR and LT2ESWTR, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, corporate PM tools, \textsf{R} programming language, PMI concepts.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Managed a small team to design a small half-million gallon-per-day, seasonally operated, water treatment plant incorporating the contact basin and clear well under the main plant.  Designed the pumping and treatment systems.  Design completed on time and on budget, meeting all of the requirements of the client and regulatory agencies.

			\smallspace
			\item Designed the installation of an emergency chlorine gas scrubber I selected for a water treatment plant.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Designed the expansion of chemical storage facilities at a water treatment plant to include spill protection, connection to existing facilities, and consideration for plant employee safety.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Analyze routes for multiple proposed pipelines to include estimates for excavation, material, and work.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Used AutoCAD CIVIL 3D tools to perform grading and pipe network design for a 64-acre multi-use, municipal park.  Considered adjacent existing roadways and irrigation ditches and associated rights-of-way.  Use of grading and pipe network tools reduced rework time when the design was changed.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Design a simple, modular system to insulate building sanitary sewer systems for a new systems being installed in multiple villages in North Slope Borough, Alaska.  Design was enthusiastically accepted by the engineering and construction teams for it's reduced cost and lowered impact on workers performing maintenance during winter and was incorporated into other projects within the Borough.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Investigate appropriate use of AutoCAD tools when creating designs of varying complexity.  Communicated benefits and limitations of these tools to senior engineers unfamiliar with them.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Create simple javascript application to calculate and present above ground, arctic, sewer system preliminary design.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Extensively used \textsf{R} to rapidly prototype possible potable water sanitation design permutations based on EPA requirements.  Drastically reduced the time between design parameter determination and final design decision.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Converted construction documents originally written in Microsoft Word to \LaTeX. Improved format consistency and reduced editing/maintenance time while enforcing compliance with Construction Specification Institute standards.

		\compDesc{Public research and land grant university studying agricultural, natural, and environmental phenomena.}
		\tools{Microsoft Office, \textsf{R} Language and Computing Environment, ArcGIS, \LaTeX, Surfer}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use \textsf{R} statistical programming language to develop multiple deterministic and stochastic models using natural, spatial, and temporal variables and their associated uncertainties to estimate daily groundwater return volume and dissolved contaminant concentration.  Replaced and expanded scope and depth of hard to update, oversimplified, Excel spreadsheet models. Text and \textsf{R} model code is available for review on https://github.com/cekmorse.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Wrote quarterly and annual reports to state agencies detailing water quality sampling efforts and results to include graphical surface representations of spatial and temporal variability.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Prepare for and execute multiple high volume water sample events. Perform suspended sediment, river bed sediment, and cross section surveys of multiple river cross sections.
			
			\smallspace
			\item  Aggregate and analyze water quality sample results with respect to spatial and temporal variability.  Analyze sediment sample results to determine necessity of further analysis.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Determine proper tools and techniques for sampling suspended and bed sediment. Determine likelihood of botanical impact on water quality parameters of interest.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Created automated scripts generating multiple types of graphical and tabular results using common formatting parameters with provisions for integrating into a large, multi-chapter \LaTeX\ document.

		\tools{GEO-SLOPE SLOPE/W and VADOSE/W, MS Office, MS Excel VBA, MS Word VBA, MATLAB.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Compiled and summarized geotechnical reports to assist senior/principal engineers in preparing expert witness testimony in support of design and construction litigation.

			\smallspace
			\item Independently collect and document soil samples from test pits and bore holes to include visual color and gradation analysis and preparation for swell/consolidation and other tests. 
			
			\smallspace
			\item Create a first-of-its-kind Excel VBA analysis to determine the appropriate depth to install micropiles for foundation remediation efforts on soils with high swell potential.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Use SLOPE/W to perform slope stability for open-pit mine closure design, ensuring safety of nearby major roadway.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Design new and analyze existing design of MSE retaining walls in accordance with Colorado DOT guidance.
			
			\smallspace
			\item Perform analysis of private and public roadway to include analysis of design, as-built, and existing condition surveys, and concrete and asphalt core lab analysis results.
			
			\smallspace
